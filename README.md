# Explore Atlantic Storms

A repository designed to facilitate exploration of hurricane data by STEM teachers attending the ESIP Education Committee's Summer Workshop. Participants will explore the notebook, ExploreAtlanticStorms.ipny, to plot hurricane tracks and intensities and plot graphs using simple statistics. The repository uses Python code in a Jupyter Notebook to explore hurricanes in the Atlantic through a computational narrative.


## Welcome

This repository is reproducible through **Jupyter Notebook**: documents that can contain cells of executable code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's like having a single document that handles word processing (such as  Word), math functions (such as Excel), image generation and display, and an interface for coding.

The name **Jupyter** refers to the three coding languages, **Julia, Python, and R**, that are pillars of the modern scientific world. 

For this workshop, we are using Google Colaboratory which is a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use.

####  Overview of workshop session
* [Slides](https://schd.ws/hosted_files/2018esipsummermeeting/ab/MILESsessionOverview.pptx)

Your Python environment requires the following:

* [python](https://python.org) >=3.6
* [numpy](https://numpy.org) >= 1.16.4
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) >= 3.1.1
* [basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap) >= 1.2.0

This workshop has been tested in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) >= 4.4.0 and Google colaboratory.

## Workshop

Time to dive in!

* Scroll up to the top of the Github repository (this page). In the upper right there is a green box that says clone or download. Click it, then copy the url to your clipboard via the clipboard icon to the right of the url or by any other method you prefer. You can use this method to import any Github repository! 

```bash
!git clone
```

* Now click this link to open Colaboratory:

### Notebooks

##### [Atlantic Storms Notebook](./ExploreAtlanticStorms.ipynb) ([NBViewer Link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Shelley-E-Olds/ExploreAtlanticStorms/blob/master/ExploreAtlanticStorms.ipynb))
* why you and your students will care
* what you'll accomplish
* what you'll see


"walk students through some basic visualizations and data analysis encouraging students to change the code displayed to answer questions such as “Where did Hurricane Sandy go?” and “What storms occurred during 1981?”. This includes a number of visualizations of hurricane tracks, coloring by strength of storms, and an analysis of average number of storms per year."


##### [Data Scrubber Notebook](./data_scrubber.ipynb) ([NBViewer Link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Shelley-E-Olds/ExploreAtlanticStorms/blob/master/data_scrubber.ipynb))
* where the data was retrieved from
* why we had to scrub the data
* how the data was normalized

##### [Explaining Python Imports](./explanation_of_initial_python_imports.ipynb) ([NBViewer Link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Shelley-E-Olds/ExploreAtlanticStorms/blob/master/explanation_of_initial_python_imports.ipynb))
* Create csv with recommendation concept content for the collection 
* translate concept names into the schema.org vocabulary
* create valid JSON-LD for a record
* Use Google's [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/) to test results
