# Explore Atlantic Storms
A repository designed to facilitate exploration of geoscience by STEM teachers attending the ESIP Education Cluster's Summer Workshop. The repository uses Python code in a Jupyter Notebook to explore hurricanes in the Atlantic through a computational narrative.

## Welcome

This repository is reproducible through <b>Jupyter Notebooks</b>: documents that can contain cells of executable code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's like having a single document that handles word processing (such as  Word), math functions (such as Excel), image generation and display, and an interface for coding.

The name <b>Jupyter</b> refers to the three coding languages, <b>Julia, Python, and R</b>, that are pillars of the modern scientific world. 

For this workshop, we are using Google Colaboratory which is a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use.

## Workshop

Time to dive in! First click this link to open Collaboratory:

* [Google Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#create=true&language=python3)
* Now scroll up to the top of the Github repository (this page). In upper right there is a 


## Getting started

*REWRITE THESE INSTRUCTIONS!*
1. (how do we do this in coLab - should we have them do the equivalent? Restart Runtime ) When you first open a Jupyter notebook, it's a best practice to select: <b>Kernel > Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs</b>. This command ensures that the notebook is in an "unused" state. 

2. (they don't / can't save - you can go through the Revision History to step back to a previous version) To preserve a clean copy of the notebook, select <b>File > Save Notebook As...</b> and give it a new name. You'll work in the newly named notebook.

3. Usually, the very first cell of a notebook is a code cell that imports necessary coding libraries and tools. In this notebook, you're reading a text cell that is right above the first code cell. 

You'll need to run the code cell below this first section (with the white background) to load essential information into your notebook. 

#### TO RUN ANY CELL

1. There are grey sections on this page that can be executed (played)

2. Hover over the  [   ] symbol, notice that it turns into a play symbol

3. Click the "play" button (arrow pointing right) at the top of the page. 


> While you run or "execute" a cell, an square appears inside the bracket to the left of the cell and a circle appears to spin. Once the code has run, the square will be replaced by a number in the brackets.

### Notebooks

##### [Atlantic Storms Notebook](./15May_atlantic_storms.ipynb)
* why you and your students will care
* what you'll accomplish
* what you'll see

##### [Data Scrubber Notebook](./data_scrubber.ipynb)
* where the data was retrieved from
* why we had to scrub the data
* how the data was normalized

##### [Explaining Python Imports](./explanation_of_initial_python_imports)
* Create csv with recommendation concept content for the collection 
* translate concept names into the schema.org vocabulary
* create valid JSON-LD for a record
* Use Google's [Structured Data Testing Tool](https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/) to test results
